# A startup is a company that is confused

"A startup is a company that is confused about 1. What its product is. 2. Who its customers are. 3. How to make money." is a quotation by Dave McClure, co-founder of 500 Startups. The quotation highlights the main challenges that startups face in their early stages.

* **1. What its product is**: highlights the importance of having a clear idea of what the startup is offering. Startups often begin with an idea or vision for a product or service, but it can be challenging to define the product and its features in a way that resonates with potential customers. This process often involves significant experimentation and iteration.

* **2. Who its customers are**: highlights the importance of understanding the target audience for the product or service. Startups often begin with a broad idea of who their target market is, but it can be challenging to identify specific customer segments that are willing to pay for the product. This process often involves market research and customer discovery.

* **3. How to make money**: highlights the challenge of monetizing the product or service. Startups often have limited resources and may struggle to identify the best revenue model for their product. This process often involves experimenting with different pricing strategies and revenue models.

The quote highlights the uncertainty and ambiguity that are inherent in the early stages of a startup. It also highlights the importance of quickly iterating and experimenting to find the right product-market fit and revenue model.
