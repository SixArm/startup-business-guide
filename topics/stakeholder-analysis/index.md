# Stakeholder analysis

Stakeholder analysis is a process of identifying and analyzing the various groups or individuals who have an interest in a particular project or organization. The goal is to understand the needs, expectations, interests, and influence of each stakeholder, in order to effectively manage relationships.

Stakeholders can be internal or external to the organization, and can include individuals or groups such as employees, customers, suppliers, investors, government agencies, NGOs, and the media.

Analysis typically involves the following steps:

* Identify stakeholders by creating a list of groups and people who may be affected by the project or organization.

* Prioritize stakeholders based on their level of interest, power, and influence.

* Assess stakeholder needs and expectations: Gather information about each stakeholder's needs, expectations, and concerns. This information can be collected through surveys, interviews, or focus groups.

* Analyze the influence of each stakeholder and their potential impact on the project or organization.

* Develop stakeholder management strategies, such as communication plans, engagement activities, and conflict resolution strategies.

Benefits of stakeholder analysis include better stakeholder relationships, improved communication, better decision-making, and risk mitigation.
