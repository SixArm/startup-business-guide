# How to create a minimum viable product (MVP)

Creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a common approach for startups and product development teams to quickly test their ideas with minimal resources. The goal is to get a basic version of the product into the hands of users, to validate assumptions and gather feedback for improvements.

**Key steps:**

* **Define:** Clearly define your target audience and their problems. Understanding the specific pain points and needs of your potential users is crucial in developing an MVP that resonates with them.

* **Design:** Identify the core features that are necessary to address the problem and deliver value. Keep the design straightforward. Get feedback as soon as possible with wireframes or prototypes.

* **Develop:** Start building the product using the essential features identified earlier, using technologies that accelerate you. Aim for a functional, but not necessarily polished, version of the product.

* **Test:** Before releasing the MVP, thoroughly test it to ensure it works as intended and doesn't have any major issues that could hinder the user experience.

* **Launch:** Release the MVP to your target audience and actively seek feedback from early adopters. Track key performance indicators (KPIs). Analyze user behavior, collect feedback, and identify how to improve.

* **Iterate:** Based on the feedback received, make adjustments to the MVP. Focus on quick iterations to address critical issues and user demands. As you validate your assumptions, gradually expand.
