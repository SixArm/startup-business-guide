# 409A valuation

A 409A valuation is a process for determining the fair market value of a private company's common stock.

The name comes from Section 409A of the United States (US) Internal Revenue Service (IRS) code. The valuation is performed by an independent third-party valuation firm and is required by the IRS for companies that issue stock options to employees.

The purpose of a 409A valuation is to ensure that employees are not receiving stock options with a strike price that is lower than the fair market value of the company's stock. If the strike price is too low, the IRS could consider it to be a form of compensation and the company and employees could face significant tax consequences.

The valuation takes into account a variety of factors, including financial performance, industry trends, market conditions, and the company's growth prospects. The valuation firm will typically use a combination of methods to determine the fair market value of the company's stock, such as the discounted cash flow method, the comparable company analysis method, or the precedent transaction analysis method.

The 409A valuation must be performed at least once every 12 months, or whenever there is a significant event that could impact the fair market value of the company's stock, such as a merger or acquisition, a financing round, or a change in the company's business strategy. The valuation report must be provided to the company's board of directors and the employees who received stock options within a reasonable time after the valuation is performed.
