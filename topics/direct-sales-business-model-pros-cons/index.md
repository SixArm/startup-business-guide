# Direct sales business model pros/cons

The direct sales business model has pros (i.e. advantages) and cons (i.e. disadvantages).

**Pros:**

* **Control over the sales process:** By selling directly to customers, companies have more control over the sales process and can tailor their approach to meet the specific needs of their customers.

* **Higher profit margins:** Companies can earn higher profit margins by cutting out middlemen and retailers, which can help them achieve greater financial success.

* **Customer insights:** By building strong relationships with customers, companies can gain valuable insights into their needs, preferences, and behavior, which can inform future product development and marketing strategies.

**Cons:**

* **High cost of sales:** The sales process in a direct sales model can be costly and time-consuming, which can impact the company's bottom line.

* **Risk of sales team turnover:** Because sales teams are often commission-based, there is a risk of high turnover, which can disrupt the sales process and impact revenue.

* **Limited scalability:** The direct sales model can be difficult to scale, as the company must invest in additional sales resources to expand its reach and customer base.
