# Cultural values

Cultural values are principles and beliefs that guide behavior, decision-making, and interactions within a particular culture or organization. Cultural values can shape individual behavior as well as organizational strategy, and can help create a shared sense of identity and purpose.

**Popular cultural value frameworks:**

* **Hofstede's cultural dimensions:** This framework looks at cultural values across six dimensions: power distance, individualism vs collectivism, masculinity vs femininity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term vs short-term orientation, and indulgence vs restraint.

* **The Trompenaars' model:** This framework looks at cultural values across seven dimensions: universalism vs particularism, individualism vs communitarianism, specific vs diffuse, neutral vs emotional, achievement vs ascription, time as sequence vs time as synchronization, and internal direction vs outer direction.

* **The Schwartz Value Theory:** This framework looks at cultural values across ten dimensions: power, achievement, hedonism, stimulation, self-direction, universalism, benevolence, tradition, conformity, and security.

These frameworks can be useful for understanding cultural differences, identifying areas of potential conflict, and developing effective strategies for cross-cultural communication and collaboration. However, it's important to remember that cultural values are complex and multifaceted, and that individuals and organizations may prioritize different values in different contexts. It's also important to approach cultural values with sensitivity and respect, avoiding stereotypes and assumptions about people based on their cultural background.
