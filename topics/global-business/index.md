# Global business

Global business refers to the economic activities and operations conducted by companies across national borders and in multiple countries. It involves the exchange of goods, services, and resources between nations, as well as the establishment and management of international business operations. Global business encompasses a wide range of activities, including trade, investment, outsourcing, supply chain management, and international expansion.

Key drivers include:

* Technology: Advances in transportation, communication, and information technologies have greatly facilitated global business operations, including transportion, communication, and information access.

* Liberalization: The reduction of trade barriers, the signing of free trade agreements, and the liberalization of markets have opened opportunities for companies to expand. This has led to increased trade flows and global supply chains.

* Access to Resources: Global business allows companies to access resources, such as raw materials, capital, and skilled labor, that may be scarce or more cost-effective in other countries.

* Economies of Scale and Scope: Global business often provides companies with economies of scale and scope. By accessing larger markets, and spreading fixed costs over more customers, businesses can achieve cost efficiencies.

Challenges and considerations include cultural differences, legal and regulatory compliance, currency and exchange rate risk, and logistics and supply chain management (SCM) both intra-country and inter-country.
