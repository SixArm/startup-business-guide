# Growth hacking

Growth hacking refers to a set of marketing strategies and tactics aimed at achieving rapid and sustained growth for a company or product. It involves using data-driven experimentation, creativity, and unconventional methods to rapidly test and iterate on different marketing approaches.

Key tenets of growth hacking include:

* A focus on metrics, such as user acquisition, activation, retention, and referral to guide efforts.

* Rapid experimentation, to test ideas and measure impact, to determine what works and what doesn't.

* Thinking outside the box, and coming up with unconventional approaches to marketing.

* Leveraging existing platforms, such as social media, search engines, and email marketing, to reach their target audience.

* A cross-functional approach, including marketing, product, engineering, and data analysis.

Examples of growth hacking tactics include:

* A/B testing: Testing different versions of marketing campaigns or product features to see which one performs better.

* Content marketing: Creating valuable content for users, such as blog posts, infographics, or videos.

* Search engine optimization (SEO): Optimizing the product's website to rank higher in search engine results.

* Viral marketing: Encouraging existing users to share the product with their friends, family, and colleagues.

* Referral programs: Encouraging users to refer their friends in exchange for a discount or other incentive.
