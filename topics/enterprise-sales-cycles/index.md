2. Qualification: Establish contact and gather relevant information about the prospect's needs, challenges, and decision processes. Qualify leads by probable value.

3. Solutioning: Conduct in-depth needs assessments. Show how the product or service works and how it addresses the prospect's specific needs. Consider a proof of concept or pilot project, to validate solution effectiveness.

4. Negotiation: Gain consensus and align stakeholders around the proposed solution. Solve concerns regarding pricing, contract terms, implementation, or customization requirements.

5. Procurement: Working with the prospect's procurement team to finalize the contract, negotiate terms, and ensure compliance with any legal or regulatory requirements.
