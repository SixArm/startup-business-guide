# Corporate social responsibility (CSR)

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) refers to a company's efforts to act ethically and responsibly towards society, the environment, and its stakeholders. CSR involves taking responsibility for the impact that a company's operations have on these various areas and ensuring that the company is making a positive contribution.

CSR is increasingly seen as a crucial component of business strategy, with many companies now viewing it as a way to improve their reputation, attract and retain customers, differentiate themselves from competitors, and mitigate risk.

There are several frameworks and standards that guide companies in developing and implementing CSR strategies. One such framework is the United Nations Global Compact, which outlines ten principles in areas such as human rights, labor rights, and environmental sustainability. The ISO 26000 standard also provides guidance on implementing CSR practices.

Some examples of CSR initiatives that companies may undertake:

* Environmental sustainability: Implement sustainable practices such as using renewable energy, reducing waste, and promoting energy efficiency.

* Community involvement: Engage with local groups, such as volunteering at charities, sponsoring community events, and providing educational opportunities.

* Ethical business practices: Eliminate exploitative labor practices, use fair trade suppliers, and ensure products are safe and of high quality.
