# Demo day

A demo day is an event typically held at the end of an accelerator program or incubation period, during which startups pitch their products, services, and business plans to a group of potential investors and other stakeholders. The purpose of a demo day is to provide startups with an opportunity to showcase their progress, gain visibility, and potentially secure funding.

Demo days are typically structured as a series of short presentations, with each startup being given a limited amount of time to present their business and value proposition to the audience. Presentations can take many forms, ranging from simple slideshows to live product demonstrations, and are often accompanied by Q&A sessions with investors and other attendees.

Demo days can be highly competitive, with startups vying for the attention of potential investors and trying to stand out from the crowd. As a result, startups often put a great deal of effort into crafting their pitches and presentations, with the goal of making a memorable impression on the audience and generating interest in their business.

Overall, demo days are an important part of the startup ecosystem, providing startups with an opportunity to showcase their work, connect with investors, and potentially secure the funding they need to grow and succeed.
