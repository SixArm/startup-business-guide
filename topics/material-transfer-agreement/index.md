# Material Transfer Agreement (MTA)

A Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) is a legal contract that governs the transfer of tangible research materials between two organizations, such as academic or research institutions, government agencies, or commercial companies.

MTAs are used when a researcher or organization wants to obtain materials from another organization for research purposes, but the provider wishes to retain ownership and control over the materials.

Typical provisions:

* Ownership and intellectual property: The MTA will specify who owns the materials being transferred, and who owns any intellectual property rights associated with the materials.

* Permitted uses: The MTA will outline the intended uses of the materials, and any restrictions on those uses.

* Liability and indemnification: The MTA will specify who is responsible for any damages or liabilities that may arise from the use of the materials, and may include provisions for indemnification or liability insurance.

* Confidentiality: The MTA will specify any restrictions on the disclosure or use of confidential information related to the materials.

* Termination: The MTA will specify the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated by either party.

MTAs are important for facilitating scientific research by enabling the sharing of research materials and promoting collaboration between organizations. They also help to ensure that the intellectual property rights of both the provider and the recipient are protected, and that any liabilities or risks are addressed.
