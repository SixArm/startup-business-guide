# Commoditization of trust

Commoditization of trust refers to the process where trust becomes a commodity in a market, and it can be bought, sold, and traded like any other product or service. This concept is often associated with the rise of digital platforms and the sharing economy, which have disrupted traditional industries and enabled new forms of peer-to-peer interactions.

In the past, trust was largely built through personal relationships and reputation, and it was difficult to transfer or replicate. However, with the rise of online platforms, trust has become more standardized and quantifiable, as users are able to rate and review each other based on their experiences.

For example, in the sharing economy, platforms such as Airbnb and Uber have created a system where users can rate and review their hosts or drivers, which helps build trust and ensures a certain level of quality. These platforms have essentially commoditized trust, as users are able to rely on the ratings and reviews of others rather than building trust through personal relationships.

The commoditization of trust has also enabled new business models, such as online marketplaces and crowdsourcing platforms, where strangers can transact with each other with a certain level of trust. However, there are also concerns about the impact of commoditized trust on privacy and security, as well as the potential for manipulation and fraud.
