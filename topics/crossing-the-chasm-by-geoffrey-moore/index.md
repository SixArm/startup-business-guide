# “Crossing the Chasm” by Geoffrey Moore

"Crossing the Chasm" is a book written by Geoffrey Moore. Moore argues that there is a significant gap, or "chasm", between early adopters of a technology product and the majority of consumers who are more conservative in their purchasing decisions. This chasm represents a major obstacle for technology companies, as it can be difficult to convince mainstream consumers to adopt new technologies.

**Key customer segment stages:**

1. **Innovators:** These are the earliest adopters of new technology products, who are willing to take risks and try new things.

2. **Early Adopters:** These customers are also willing to take risks, but they are more pragmatic and focused on finding practical solutions to problems.

3. **Early Majority:** This is the largest customer segment, and they are more cautious than early adopters. They want to see evidence that a technology product is reliable and delivers real value before adopting it.

4. **Late Majority:** This segment is even more conservative than the early majority, and they are often skeptical of new technologies.

5. **Laggards:** These are the last customers to adopt new technologies, often only doing so when it becomes necessary.

Moore argues that technology companies should focus their marketing efforts on the early adopter segment, using case studies and other evidence to demonstrate the value and reliability of their products. Once they have established a strong customer base among early adopters, they can use this momentum to cross the chasm and appeal to the early majority.
