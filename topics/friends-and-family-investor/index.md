# Friends and family investor

A friends and family investor refers to individuals within an entrepreneur's personal network, who can provide financial support for a business venture. These individuals invest their personal funds into the venture, typically in the early stages when other sources of funding may be limited or unavailable.

More in-depth explanation:

* Relationship-based: These people invest because of a personal connection with the entrepreneur. The relationship factor differentiates these investos from other types of investors, such as angel investors or venture capitalists.

* Early-stage Funding: These people typically contribute capital during the early stages of a business when it is in the concept stage. At this point, the entrepreneur may not have a track record or significant assets to secure financing.

* Non-financial Support: Friends and family investors may provide help to the entrepreneur and the business, such as advice, mentorship, business expertise, networking connections, or operational assistance.

For entrepreneurs seeking investment from friends and family, it is important to approach these arrangements with professionalism and transparency. Mixing personal relationships with business transactions can sometimes lead to strained relationships or conflicts if the business does not perform as expected. It is crucial for both parties to have clear expectations, communication channels, and a thorough understanding of the risks involved.
