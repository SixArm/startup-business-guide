# Franchise business model

The franchise business model is a type of business model in which a franchisor (the parent company) licenses its brand, business model, and operating system to a franchisee (an independent business owner). In exchange for the license, the franchisee pays an initial franchise fee and ongoing royalties to the franchisor.

**Key components:**

* **Brand and business model:** The franchisor has established a successful brand and business model that the franchisee will adopt. This includes everything from the product or service offerings to the marketing and advertising strategies.

* **Franchise agreement:** The franchise agreement is a legal contract between the franchisor and the franchisee that outlines the terms of the franchise relationship. This includes the initial franchise fee, ongoing royalties, and other requirements such as training and support.

* **Training and support:** The franchisor provides training and support to the franchisee to help them operate their business successfully. This may include initial training before the business opens, ongoing support and education, and access to resources such as marketing materials and operational manuals.

* **Royalties:** The franchisee pays ongoing royalties to the franchisor, typically a percentage of their revenue, in exchange for continued access to the brand, business model, and support.

* **Operational requirements:** The franchisor sets operational requirements for the franchisee to follow, such as purchasing supplies from approved vendors, adhering to specific branding guidelines, and following established operating procedures.
