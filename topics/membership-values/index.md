# Membership values

Membership values refer to the shared principles, beliefs, and expectations that guide the behavior and interactions of members within a particular group or community. These values can be explicit or implicit, and they help to create a sense of identity, belonging, and purpose among members.

Membership values can vary widely depending on the group or community in question. For example, a professional association might prioritize ethical behavior, collaboration, and continuing education.

**Examples:**

* **Respect:** Members of a group or community are expected to show respect for each other, as well as for the group's rules, traditions, and history.

* **Trust:** Members are expected to be reliable and trustworthy, and to act in the best interests of the group as a whole.

* **Integrity:** Members are expected to act with honesty and integrity, and to hold themselves accountable for their actions.

* **Inclusivity:** Members are expected to be inclusive and welcoming of others, regardless of differences in background, identity, or perspective.

* **Collaboration:** Members are expected to work together collaboratively, sharing knowledge, resources, and expertise to achieve common goals.

Membership values can help to create a sense of community and shared purpose among members, and can also provide a basis for decisions and conflict resolution within the group. However, it's important to recognize that membership values can also be exclusionary, and may not reflect the perspectives or needs of all members equally. It's important to approach membership values with sensitivity and openness, and willingness to engage in ongoing dialogue.
