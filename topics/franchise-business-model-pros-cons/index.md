# Franchise business model pros/cons

The franchise business model has pros (i.e. advantages) and cons (i.e. disadvantages) for the franchisor and franchisee.

**Pros:**

* **Established brand:** The franchisor has already established a successful brand and business model, which can help the franchisee attract customers and build a loyal customer base.

* **Reduced risk:** The franchisee benefits from reduced risk, as they are operating a proven business model with an established customer base.

* **Training and support:** The franchisor provides training and support to help the franchisee operate their business successfully, which can help inexperienced business owners achieve success.

* **Economies of scale:** The franchisor can achieve economies of scale by sharing resources such as marketing materials and operational manuals with multiple franchisees.

**Cons:**

* **Limited flexibility:** The franchisee must follow the franchisor's established brand and business model, which can limit their flexibility in operating their business.

* **Ongoing fees:** The franchisee must pay ongoing royalties to the franchisor, which can impact their profitability.

* **Reputation risk:** If a franchisee operates their business poorly or engages in unethical behavior, it can reflect poorly on the entire franchise system and damage the franchisor's brand.
