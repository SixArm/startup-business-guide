# Social value orientation (SVO)

Social value orientation (SVO) is a psychological construct that describes an individual's preference for how they distribute resources in social situations. It refers to the extent to which an individual values cooperation and helping others, versus competition and self-interest.

There are three main types of social value orientations:

* Prosocial: Individuals with a prosocial orientation are cooperative and tend to prioritize the welfare of others over their own. They are willing to sacrifice their own resources to benefit others.

* Individualistic: Individuals with an individualistic orientation are competitive and prioritize their own interests over others. They are focused on maximizing their own outcomes and do not prioritize the welfare of others.

* Competitive: Individuals with a competitive orientation are focused on maximizing their own outcomes, but are also willing to harm others in order to achieve their goals. They prioritize their own interests over the welfare of others and may engage in behaviors that are seen as unethical or unfair.

SVO is often measured through games and tasks that require participants to make choices about how to allocate resources to themselves and others.

An individual's social value orientation can have a significant impact on their behavior in social situations, including their willingness to cooperate, trust, and punish others. Individuals with a prosocial orientation are more likely to engage in cooperative behaviors and to trust others, while those with an individualistic or competitive orientation are more likely to engage in selfish or harmful behaviors.

Understanding an individual's social value orientation can be useful in a variety of settings, such as in business negotiations, conflict resolution, or in designing public policies that promote cooperation and social welfare.
