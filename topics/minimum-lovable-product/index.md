# Minimum Lovable Product (MLP)

Minimum Lovable Product (MLP) is a product development approach that focuses on creating the smallest possible version of a product that is still able to delight customers and provide value. The goal is to create a product that is not only functional but also emotionally engaging, creating a connection with users and making them want to use it repeatedly.

The concept of MLP is a variation of the minimum viable product (MVP) approach, which involves creating a product with the minimum set of features necessary to satisfy early adopters and test the market. While MVP aims to test the viability of a product idea, MLP goes one step further by ensuring that the product is not only viable but also desirable and lovable.

The key difference between MLP and MVP is that MLP prioritizes the emotional and experiential aspects of a product, rather than just its functionality. This means that MLP focuses on creating a product that is not only useful but also engaging, delightful, and easy to use.

**Key benefits:**

* **Faster time-to-market:** By focusing on the minimum set of features necessary to create a lovable product, product teams can often get their product to market faster, which can be crucial.

* **Greater user engagement:** By creating a product that is emotionally engaging and easy to use, product teams can increase user engagement and retention, leading to higher customer lifetime value and increased revenue.

* **Reduced risk:** By testing the product with real users early on in the development process, product teams can reduce the risk of building a product that does not generate sufficient demand.
