# Convertible note

A convertible note is a type of short-term debt financing commonly used by startups, which can be converted into equity at a later date. It is essentially a loan that converts into equity when a certain event, such as a future funding round or an acquisition, takes place. Convertible notes are usually issued to early-stage investors who provide seed funding to startups.

The key features of a convertible note typically include:

* Low interest rate. Ranges from 2% to 8% per annum.

* Maturity date: when the loan becomes due and payable. Ranges from 18 to 24 months.

* Equity conversion and discount: a bonus offered to investors in the future, if they convert their debt into equity. Ranges from 10% to 20%.

* Conversion cap: the maximum valuation at which the debt can be converted into equity. The conversion cap protects investors from being diluted if the company has a high valuation at the time of conversion.

* Repayment: If the startup is unable to raise funds or is unable to meet the repayment obligations, the convertible note may be converted into equity, or it may be repaid with interest.

Convertible notes are popular among startups because they offer a way to raise capital without having to agree on a valuation, which can be difficult in the early stages of a startup.

However, convertible notes also have some drawbacks, due to legal fees and administrative costs.
