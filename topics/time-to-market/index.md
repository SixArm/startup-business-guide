# Time-to-market (TTM)

Time-to-market (TTM) is the amount of time it takes for a company to bring a new product or service to market, from the initial idea or concept to the launch of the product or service.

TTM can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the complexity of the product or service, the regulatory environment, supply chain constraints, manufacturing and production processes, the speed and effectiveness of the development and testing process, and the company's commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

Shortening TTM is a key goal for many businesses, as it can provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace. By getting products or services to market more quickly, companies can respond more effectively to changes in customer demand, stay ahead of competitors, and capture market share before others do.

To improve TTM, companies may adopt a range of strategies, such as:

* Lean development processes, such as agile or DevOps, can help companies streamline the development and testing process, reducing the time it takes to bring products to market.

* Rapid prototyping can help companies quickly develop and test new product concepts, allowing them to refine designs and features before investing in full-scale production.

* Supply chain optimization can help companies reduce lead times for raw materials and components, improving manufacturing and production efficiency.

* Outsourcing certain aspects of the development process, such as design or testing, can help companies speed up product development and reduce costs.

* Regulatory compliance preparation can help companies avoid delays in getting products to market and reduce the risk of legal or financial penalties.
