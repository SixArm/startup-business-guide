# Marketplace business model

The marketplace business model is a type of business model that connects buyers and sellers on a single platform, allowing them to transact with each other. The marketplace operator typically generates revenue by charging a commission or transaction fee on each sale made through the platform.

**Key components:**

* **Platform:** The marketplace operator provides a platform that connects buyers and sellers. This platform can take various forms, such as a website, mobile app, or software platform.

* **Listings:** Sellers list their products or services on the platform, providing details such as price, product description, and images.

* **Search and discovery:** Buyers can search for products or services on the platform using keywords or filters, and the platform provides search results based on relevance.

* **Transactions:** Buyers can purchase products or services directly from sellers through the platform. The platform typically facilitates the transaction, providing tools such as payment processing and shipping integration.

* **Commission or transaction fees:** The marketplace operator charges a commission or transaction fee on each sale made through the platform. This fee can be a percentage of the sale price or a flat fee per transaction.
