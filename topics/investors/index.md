# Investors

Investors play a crucial role in the success of a startup. There are various types of investors who can provide funding to startups and businesses.

Typical types:

* Friends and family investors: These are often the first funders, and invest based on personal relationships, rather than a business plan. However, there are risks of conflicts and strained relationships.

* Angel investors: Angel investors are high net worth individuals who provide funding in the early stages of development, before a proven track record. They typically invest less than venture capital firms. They provide valuable mentorship.

* Venture capital investors: These are professional investors who provide funding to startups with high growth potential. They are typically looking for a very high return on their investment.

* Seed investors: For startups that did not have an angel round, seed funding rounds are the first major outside investment they receive. The money received is usually used to cover the costs of product development and marketing.

* Series A investors: They provide funding to startups that have a track record of success and are looking to scale up their operations. These investors look for companies that have a proven business model and path to profitability.

* Series B investors: They provide funding to startups that have achieved significant growth and are looking to expand into new markets or product lines. These investors look for companies with a solid revenue stream and paths to continuing growth.
