# Globalization

Globalization refers to the increasing interconnectedness and interdependence of countries and people across the globe. It is driven by advances in technology, communication, transportation, and the liberalization of trade and investment.
Economic globalization is characterized by the free flow of goods, services, capital, and labor across borders. This integration is facilitated by the removal of trade barriers, such as tariffs and quotas, and the establishment of international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), which promotes and regulates global trade.

Globalization has resulted in the expansion of multinational corporations (MNCs) and the establishment of global supply chains. MNCs operate in multiple countries, capitalizing on lower production costs, accessing new markets, and leveraging global resources. Global supply chains involve the sourcing of raw materials, production, and distribution of goods across different countries, creating a global network of economic interdependence.

Politically there is international cooperation on issues such as climate change, terrorism, and human rights. The formation of regional blocs, such as the European Union (EU), has led to collaboration among member countries.

Culturally there is increased international travel, migration, communication, and spreading cultural influences such as language, music, fashion, and cuisine. However, concerns have been raised about loss of cultural diversity.

Environmentally there is increased movement of goods and people, leading to surges in energy use, pollution, and the depletion of resources. Climate change, deforestation, and biodiversity loss are challenges exacerbated by globalization.
