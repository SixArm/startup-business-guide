3. Collaborate: Work with internal departments, such as sales, marketing, product development, customer support, and operations. Leverage the organization's expertise, resources, and capabilities to meet the specific needs of key accounts.

4. Deliver Vaule: Define success metrics to assess the organization's performance, identify opportunities for improvement, and show impact. Data-driven approaches strengthen the account's trust and confidence in the organization.

5. Managing Risk: Identify and mitigate any risks, challenges, or threats with accounts. Ensure the continuity and resilience of the account partnership.

6. Manage: Maximize customer lifetime value via contract renewals, upselling, and cross-selling. Consistently demonstrate value.
