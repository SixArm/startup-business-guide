# Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of security standards established by major credit card companies, to ensure that merchants and service providers who handle cardholder data are protecting it in a secure manner. PCI DSS applies to any organization that accepts, processes, stores, or transmits credit card data.

The standard includes 12 requirements:

* Use a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.

* Do not use default passwords and security parameters provided by the vendors.

* Protect stored cardholder data.

* Encrypt transmission of cardholder data.

* Use and regularly update anti-virus software.

* Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.

* Restrict access to cardholder data to need-to-know.

* Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.

* Restrict physical access to cardholder data.

* Monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.

* Regularly test security systems and processes.

* Maintain a policy that addresses information security.

PCI DSS compliance can be achieved through self-assessment or via a qualified security assessor (QSA) formal audit. Failure to comply can result in fines and bans. Additionally, data breaches resulting from non-compliance can cause damage to the reputation of the affected organization and result in legal action by customers and regulatory authorities.
