# Global Reporting Initiative

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an independent, non-profit organization that promotes sustainability reporting among organizations around the world. Founded in 1997, GRI has become a widely accepted and internationally recognized framework for sustainability reporting.

The primary aim of GRI is to help organizations report their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance to their stakeholders in a clear, consistent, and transparent manner. The GRI Standards provide a set of guidelines for companies to report on their sustainability performance in a standardized way.

The GRI Standards cover a range of sustainability topics, including governance, anti-corruption, human rights, labor practices, emissions, energy, water, biodiversity, and supply chain sustainability. Companies can use the GRI Standards to report on their sustainability performance, which allows stakeholders, including investors, employees, customers, and the general public, to understand their ESG impact.

The GRI Standards are updated periodically to reflect changing sustainability practices and stakeholder expectations. As a result, GRI provides a dynamic framework that helps companies stay current on sustainability issues and trends.
