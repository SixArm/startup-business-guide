# Fixed costs

Fixed costs are expenses that do not vary with changes in the level of output or production of a business. They are expenses that a business incurs regardless of how much it produces or sells, and are typically time-based, meaning they are incurred over a specific period of time, such as a month or a year.

Fixed costs can include items such as rent or lease payments, salaries or wages for employees, insurance premiums, property taxes, and other overhead expenses. These costs are often necessary for the operation of the business, but do not change in proportion to changes in the level of production or sales.

One of the defining characteristics of fixed costs is that they are considered to be sunk costs. This means that the costs have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, regardless of the level of production or sales. For example, a business that has signed a lease for a building has committed to paying the fixed rent amount for the term of the lease, even if sales decline or production stops.

Fixed costs are important for businesses to understand because they have a significant impact on the break-even point, which is the point at which the business begins to generate a profit. Because fixed costs do not change with changes in production or sales, they represent a constant cost that must be covered before a business can begin to generate a profit. As a result, businesses with high fixed costs may need to generate higher levels of revenue or production in order to achieve profitability.

Fixed costs are also important for businesses to manage, as they can have a significant impact on the cash flow and profitability of the business. By accurately forecasting fixed costs and managing them effectively, businesses can better control their expenses and allocate resources more efficiently.
